# IOWA_Liquor_Sales
Overview : 
This project focuses on analyzing liquor sales data from Iowa. The primary goal is to gain insights into liquor sales trends, patterns, and customer preferences within the state. The project utilizes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to process the data, beginning with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio. This is followed by data integration, preparation, cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Alteryx, Power BI, and Tableau.

Dataset : 
The dataset used in this project contains information about liquor sales in Iowa. It includes details such as sales dates, product types, quantities sold, prices, and customer demographics. Analyzing this dataset can provide valuable insights into the liquor market dynamics and consumer behavior within Iowa.

Process : 
Dimensional Model Creation: The project initiated with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio. This model served to organize and structure the data for efficient analysis and querying. Subsequently, the model was converted into SQL scripts to establish a new database.

Data Integration and Preparation with Alteryx: Following dimensional model creation, the datasets underwent integration and preparation using Alteryx. This stage involved merging multiple datasets, handling data inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis.

Data Cleaning, Transforming, and Staging: Post data integration, the dataset underwent cleaning, transforming, and staging processes. This encompassed tasks such as handling missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis. The cleaned and transformed data was then staged for loading into the database.

Database Storage: The cleaned and transformed data was stored in the newly created database. This ensured organized and accessible data for further analysis and querying, facilitating combined analysis of liquor sales data from different sources.

Visualization with Power BI and Tableau: The final step involved visualizing insights derived from the combined datasets using both Power BI and Tableau. Various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards were created to showcase key trends and patterns in liquor sales within Iowa.
