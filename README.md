# IOWA_Liquor_Sales
Overview : 
This project focuses on analyzing liquor sales data from Iowa, aiming to derive insights into sales trends, patterns, and consumer behavior. The project utilizes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to integrate, clean, transform, and analyze data from two distinct datasets: Iowa Liquor Sales. The project leverages ER Studio for dimensional modeling, Alteryx for data preparation, and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau for visualizing insights.

Datasets : 
The project combines two datasets: Iowa Liquor Sales Data. These datasets contain detailed information about liquor sales in Iowa, including sales dates, liquor types, quantities sold, prices, and more.

Process : 
Dimensional Model Creation: The project initiates with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio. The model helps structure the data for efficient analysis and querying. The model is converted into SQL scripts to establish a new database.

Data Preparation, Integration, and Profiling with Alteryx: The datasets undergo data preparation, integration, and profiling using Alteryx. This step involves integrating the datasets, identifying patterns, and assessing data quality.

Data Cleaning, Transforming, and Staging: Post-profiling, the datasets undergo cleaning, transforming, and staging processes. Missing values are addressed, formats are standardized, and data is prepared for analysis. The cleaned and transformed data is staged for loading into the database.

Database Storage: The cleaned and transformed data from both datasets are stored in the newly created database. This ensures organized and accessible data for analysis and querying, facilitating combined analysis from both datasets.

Visualization with Power BI and Tableau: The final step involves visualizing insights derived from the combined datasets using Power BI and Tableau. Various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, are created to showcase key trends and patterns in Iowa liquor sales.
